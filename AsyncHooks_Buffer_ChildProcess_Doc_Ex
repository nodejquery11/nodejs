# Async Hooks [http://thlorenz.com/talks/async-hooks/book/what_are_async_hooks/what_are_async_hooks_0.html]
? what is Async hooks
Async hooks allow to the developer to track the asyschronus request and handle their entier life-cycle.
? Why do we need it
Few callback may be called multiple time for example like connection string and few are call at once like file reading. So it will just 
let the developer knows that which process call multiple callBacks asynchronusly.
 $ few methods in Async hooks
    let eid = async_hooks.executionAsyncId(); [current execution context id][initially it must be 1]
    let tid = async_hooks.triggerAsyncId(); [responsible for triggering the callback of the current execution scope to call][shows: 0]
    const asyncHooks = aynsc_hooks.createHook({ init, before, after, distroy, promiseSolved }); [it will create the async hooks 
    instance, all parameters are optional]
    asyncHooks.enable(); [to enable the new async hooks]
    asyncHooks.disable(); [to disable the current async hooks]
    function init(asyncId, type, triggerAsyncId, resource) [it will created during object constructor][promiseResolve called once 
    resolve function passed into the promise function]

? Where can we use it

# Working on clustor using Node JS
? What is cluster

cluster is the concept in the node js and it will give the ability to node js to run in the multi core system. As node js single threaded
and single process but clustor give ability to node js to create child process or worker node. So your application will run into multiple
code system and performance will go increse and handle the load balancing.

? How It Works

Cluster/Master listen the main port and Worker process r child process using child_porcess.fork() method and connect with master using IPC.
Two reasons, 
  > to use the cluster because it will not allow to do overloading, 
  > and interesed workers can use the listen port.

var http = require('http');
var cluster = require('cluster');
var numCPUs = require('os').cpus().length;
if(cluster.isMaster){
  for(var i=0; i<numCPUs; i++) {
     cluster.fork(); //this will divide the number of process into different child process or worker of core system
  }
  cluster.on('exit', function(worker, code, signal) { //if any core system get die 
    consloe.log(`Worker ${worker} died`);
  });
 } else {
   http.creatServer(function(req, res, next) {
     res.writeHead(200);
     res.end('Vikas Bose');
   }).listen(3000);
 } [this code will first check the mater CPU, then it will create child process and then run the connection string all the worker CPUs]

Cluster module allow to create the child process and share the same port
if you try to print the cluster class then it will send the object with below values
  { "domain": null,
    "_events": {}, //Empty object, so might you can define your event manually
    "_eventsCount": 0,
    "isWorker": false, //If the process not Master then it is return the negative value. 
    "isMaster": true, //If process.env.NODE_UNIQUE_ID determine by the Node and it is undefine then process must be master and it will set true 
    "worker": {}, // 
    "setting": {}, // 
    "schedulingPolicy": 1, // 
    "SCHED_NONE": 1, // 
    "SCHED_RR": 2
  }

Related `Events` in Worker Class
 If you want to perform event in root level
  1. cluster.on('disconnect') // for all workers disconnect
  2.  process.on('error') // if any error via worker
 If you perform event in worker or core system level  
  1. cluster.fork().on('disconnect', () => { .... }); //specific worker can be disconnect
  2. cluster.fork().on('exit', (code, signal) => { ... }); OR cluster.fork().on('exit');
